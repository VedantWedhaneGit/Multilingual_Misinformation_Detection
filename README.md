# Multilingual Misinformation Detector

**A research-grade, explainable AI system for detecting fake news in English, Hindi, and Marathi, leveraging advanced transformer models and a cross-lingual dataset.**

---

## 🌟 Motivation

The rapid spread of misinformation in digital news poses significant risks to public discourse, public health, and democracy. This project seeks to advance robust, multilingual AI solutions to combat misinformation and support fact-checking in diverse linguistic environments.

## Model Performance
| Language | Accuracy | F1-Score |
|----------|----------|----------|
| English  | 95%      | 0.93     |
| Hindi    | 96%      | 0.94     |
| Marathi  | 95%      | 0.92     |

_(Evaluated on balanced test sets; see /results/model_performance_by_language.csv for details.)_

## How it Works

- **Architecture**: XLM-RoBERTa fine-tuned for multilingual fake/real news classification
- **Process**: Paste any news article in one of three languages—see instant prediction and model reasoning
- **Explainability**: Probability bars and rationale for model decision (no SHAP images included in repo)

---

## Limitations

- May misclassify ambiguous or out-of-domain articles (see README for sample errors)
- Certain domains (e.g., science/tech news) or extremely short texts may yield less reliable predictions.

---

## For Reviewers

- All screenshots are real results from the live app across languages/types.
- This project is part of an advanced NLP and AI portfolio. For local setup, retraining, or deeper code/model review, please refer to included instructions or contact the author.
- Feedback, audit requests, and collaboration opportunities are welcome.
